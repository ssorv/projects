Open the File Containing the Allow List
To commence the algorithm, I initialized the import_file variable with the file name "allow_list.txt." Utilizing a with statement, I opened the file for reading:
import_file = "allowed_ip.txt"
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
 allowed_ip = file.read()

In this section, the with statement is employed with the .open() function in read mode to access the IP addresses stored in the "allow_list.txt" file. This structure ensures proper resource management by automatically closing the file after leaving the with statement.
Read the File Contents
To read the file contents, I utilized the .read() method, converting them into a string:
allowed_ip = allowed_ip.split()

This code segment splits the string into a list of IP addresses, facilitating subsequent removal operations.
Convert the String into a List
To facilitate the removal of individual IP addresses, I transformed the string into a list using the .split() method:
allowed_ip = allowed_ip.split()
The .split() method divides the string into list elements, using whitespace as the default separator.
Iterate Through the Remove List
A crucial step involves iterating through the IP addresses in the remove_list. I implemented this using a for loop:
for element in allowed_ip:
 if element in remove_list:
 allowed_ip.remove(element)
This for loop assesses whether each element in the allowed_ip list matches any element in the remove_list. If a match is found, the corresponding IP address is removed from the list.
Remove IP Addresses from the Allow List
To remove identified IP addresses from the allow list, I employed the following code:
for element in allowed_ip:
 if element in remove_list:
 allowed_ip.remove(element)

This section removes IP addresses found in the remove_list from the allowed_ip list.
Update the File with the Revised List of IP Addresses
In the final step, I updated the "allow_list.txt" file with the modified list of IP addresses. First, I converted the list back into a string using the .join() method:
allowed_ip = " ".join(allowed_ip)
Then, I used another with statement and the .write() method to overwrite the file:
with open(import_file, "w") as file:
 file.write(allowed_ip)
This code writes the updated IP addresses as a string to the "allow_list.txt" file, ensuring that any removed IP addresses no longer have access to restricted content.
Summary
I successfully developed an algorithm to eliminate specified IP addresses from the "allow_list.txt" file, effectively managing access to restricted content. The algorithm involves reading the file, converting it to a list, iterating through the remove_list, removing relevant IP addresses, and updating the file with the revised list.
